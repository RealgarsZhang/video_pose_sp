HOW TO RUN:

Put the frame images into ./gan_out. Run make_video.py to generate .gif.
The frame images are ordered by their ID. The naming convention is <DESCRP>_<ID>.png.

RESULTS:
keyframe_fake_res: keeps the keyframe generation results.
interpolation_res: the Super-SloMo interpolation result.
monkeynet_gan_res: MonkeyNet result. Input is a real reference image and a GAN generated video.
monkeynet_real_res: MonkeyNet result. Input is a real reference image and a real video. As baseline for comparison. Also to test the functionality of MonkeyNet.


gif naming convention: videoname followed by reference image name.
