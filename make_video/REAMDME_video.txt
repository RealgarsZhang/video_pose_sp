HOW TO RUN:

Put the frame images into ./gan_out. Run make_video.py to generate .gif.
The frame images are ordered by their ID. The naming convention is <DESCRP>_<ID>.png.

RESULTS:
keyframe_fake_res: keeps the keyframe generation results.
res: the results output by MonkeyNet. Some filenames end with "real", meaning they are generated from real video and images by MonkeyNet.

gif naming convention: videoname followed by reference image name.
